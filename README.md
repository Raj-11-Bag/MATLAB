# Simulink and MATLAB Control Systems Projects

This repository features two MATLAB/Simulink projects focusing on control systems design and analysis. The first project involves the implementation of PID controllers for a dynamic system, and the second project simulates a DC motor to analyze its performance under various electrical and mechanical conditions.

## Project 1: PID Controller Implementation

### Description
This project demonstrates the design and tuning of a PID controller using Simulink. The objective is to regulate the response of a dynamic system by applying different control strategies, including P, PI, and PID controllers. By adjusting these control parameters, the system's stability and performance are optimized, providing insights into the behavior of control systems.

### Key Features
